## About

This repository is for security professionals, developers, and students who want working examples next to the theory. A typical topic contains:

- **Documentation** on how the threat works
- **Detection scripts** that look for signs of the attack
- **Prevention examples** with code
- **Best practices** for implementation

The scripts are teaching material. Read and test them in a lab before relying on them in production.

## Project status

This is an early-stage guide. Six categories exist, and most topics have documentation plus detection and prevention scripts. Several topics named in earlier versions of this README are not written yet; they are listed under [Roadmap](#roadmap) instead of being counted as done.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip
- Basic understanding of networking and security concepts
- Administrative privileges for scripts that capture packets or inspect processes

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s4ntrx/Cybersecurity-Threats-Guide.git
cd Cybersecurity-Threats-Guide
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

Some scripts also need system software: `tshark` (Wireshark) for `traffic_analyzer.py` and a running Redis server for `rate_limiting.py`. Registry checks in the ransomware detector only run on Windows.

3. Optional: memory forensics support (installs Volatility 3):

```bash
pip install -r tools/requirements-optional.txt
```

`tools/setup_tools.sh` checks your Python version and system tools if you prefer a guided setup.

## Usage

### Running detection scripts

```bash
cd 01-network-security/ddos-attacks/detection/
sudo python ddos_detection.py --interface eth0 --threshold 1000
```

Run `python <script>.py --help` to see the options for any script.

### Using prevention examples

```bash
cd 02-web-application-security/sql-injection/prevention/
python parameterized_queries.py
```

Or import the class directly:

```python
from parameterized_queries import SecureDatabaseQueries

db = SecureDatabaseQueries(db_type="sqlite", db_name="demo.db")
db.connect()
db.create_users_table()
user = db.get_user_secure("alice")
```

## Web app and API

- `cybersec-app/` is a Next.js site that presents the guide's content. Setup is in [cybersec-app/README.md](cybersec-app/README.md).
- `api/` is a small Flask API with health, tools, and scan endpoints. It is experimental: its HTML routes expect `templates/` and `static/` directories that are not in the repository yet.

## Roadmap

Remaining gaps:

- New topics were added in October 2026 and are marked Draft: their references still need an independent review, and several "Real-world example" sections need a primary source added
- Apply the [topic template](TOPIC_TEMPLATE.md) (standards mapping and review date) to the older topics: ransomware, trojans, rootkits, phishing, pretexting, DDoS, MITM, port scanning, forensics
- SQL injection WAF rules; a README for the containment scripts and for symmetric encryption
- Topics listed as planned in the category pages: ARP poisoning page, worms, botnets, quid pro quo, vishing, smishing
- A `resources/` folder of links, books, and certifications
- Test the scripts that change system state (firewall, isolation, sandbox, kernel hardening, secure boot, antivirus configuration) in a disposable virtual machine; they have only been reviewed by reading the code
